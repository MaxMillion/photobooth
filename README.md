# photobooth



## Overview
---

First iteration of a very simple implementation of a browser-based photobooth, done over the course of a couple hours on the weekend.  

Since this application uses [getUserMedia](http://caniuse.com/stream), supported browsers are:

- Chrome 21+
- Firefox 17+
- Opera 12+

**getuserMedia** is available in Firefox Nightly (although for Firefox you'll need to type **about:config** in the url bar and set **media.navigator.enabled** to **true**).


***Note*****:  I have only really tested on Chrome, so there are no assurances of this working, let alone looking decent, on the other "supported" browsers.

###To-do
---
- refactor javascript code
- clean up css
- add support to share pictures through email, posting to social sites, etcâ€¦
- ability to edit pictures
- add animation sugar to filmstrip reel
- add full support to all above browers

###Known issues
---
- effects seem buggy on Chrome (more than likely my code)
- effects do not work at all on Firefox
